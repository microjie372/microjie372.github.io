### **Algorithm Intern**  
**March 2024 â€“ August 2024 | Beijing Novauto Technology Co., Ltd.**  

Researched on multi-dataset fusion for 3D object detection algorithms in autonomous driving.

#### Key Contributions:  
- Designed a pre-training framework based on point cloud reconstruction to learn unified representations between different datasets and improve generalization ability, thereby facilitating fine-tuning of subsequent detection tasks.  
- Realized higher performance of networks trained on multiple datasets than those trained on a single dataset.
