Hello, I'm a first-year PhD student advised by Dr. Jiawei Zhang at the Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis. My current research interests lie in the 3D Reconstruction based on deep learning. Before this, I have received the B.S. degree and the M.S. degree in the School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Sun Yat-Sen University, in 2022 and 2025. During the master period, I gained much experience about 3D Object Detection for autonomous vehicles.
